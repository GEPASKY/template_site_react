 *
 * The TLS Handshake Protocol involves the following steps:
 *
 * - Exchange hello messages to agree on algorithms, exchange random values,
 * and check for session resumption.
 *
 * - Exchange the necessary cryptographic parameters to allow the client and
 * server to agree on a premaster secret.
 *
 * - Exchange certificates and cryptographic information to allow the client
 * and server to authenticate themselves.
 *
 * - Generate a master secret from the premaster secret and exchanged random
 * values.
 *
 * - Provide security parameters to the record layer.
 *
 * - Allow the client and server to verify that their peer has calculated the
 * same security parameters and that the handshake occurred without tampering
 * by an attacker.
 *
 * Up to 4 different messages may be sent during a key exchange. The server
 * certificate, the server key exchange, the client certificate, and the
 * client key exchange.
 *
 * A typical handshake (from the client's perspective).
 *
 * 1. Client sends ClientHello.
 * 2. Client receives ServerHello.
 * 3. Client receives optional Certificate.
 * 4. Client receives optional ServerKeyExchange.
 * 5. Client receives ServerHelloDone.
 * 6. Client sends optional Certificate.
 * 7. Client sends ClientKeyExchange.
 * 8. Client sends optional CertificateVerify.
 * 9. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 10. Client sends Finished.
 * 11. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 12. Client receives Finished.
 * 13. Client sends/receives application data.
 *
 * To reuse an existing session:
 *
 * 1. Client sends ClientHello with session ID for reuse.
 * 2. Client receives ServerHello with same session ID if reusing.
 * 3. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec message if reusing.
 * 4. Client receives Finished.
 * 5. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 6. Client sends Finished.
 *
 * Note: Client ignores HelloRequest if in the middle of a handshake.
 *
 * Record Layer:
 *
 * The record layer fragments information blocks into TLSPlaintext records
 * carrying data in chunks of 2^14 bytes or less. Client message boundaries are
 * not preserved in the record layer (i.e., multiple client messages of the
 * same ContentType MAY be coalesced into a single TLSPlaintext record, or a
 * single message MAY be fragmented across several records).
 *
 * struct {
 *   uint8 major;
 *   uint8 minor;
 * } ProtocolVersion;
 *
 * struct {
 *   ContentType type;
 *   ProtocolVersion version;
 *   uint16 length;
 *   opaque fragment[TLSPlaintext.length];
 * } TLSPlaintext;
 *
 * type:
 *   The higher-level protocol used to process the enclosed fragment.
 *
 * version:
 *   The version of the protocol being employed. TLS Version 1.2 uses version
 *   {3, 3}. TLS Version 1.0 uses version {3, 1}. Note that a client that
 *   supports multiple versions of TLS may not know what version will be
 *   employed before it receives the ServerHello.
 *
 * length:
 *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSPlaintext.fragment. The length
 *   MUST NOT exceed 2^14 = 16384 bytes.
 *
 * fragment:
 *   The application data. This data is transparent and treated as an
 *   independent block to be dealt with by the higher-level protocol specified
 *   by the type field.
 *
 * Implementations MUST NOT send zero-length fragments of Handshake, Alert, or
 * ChangeCipherSpec content types. Zero-length fragments of Application data
 * MAY be sent as they are potentially useful as a traffic analysis
 * countermeasure.
 *
 * Note: Data of different TLS record layer content types MAY be interleaved.
 * Application data is generally of lower precedence for transmission than
 * other content types. However, records MUST be delivered to the network in
 * the same order as they are protected by the record layer. Recipients MUST
 * receive and process interleaved application layer traffic during handshakes
 * subsequent to the first one on a connection.
